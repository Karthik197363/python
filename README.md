Machine learning project,which uses "random forest regressor" imported from sklearn module.
This project was created in GOOGLE CO-LAB so the code is available only in pdf format here.
The gold price data set is downloaded from "Google".
While adding the file location in the "pandas" dataframe,make sure that the dataset is imported in the Google colab.
Dataset manipulation such as accesing the head and tail of the dataset is not mandatory so it can be ignored here in this program to reduce code size.
Here in this example we use heat map to analyse the correlation..it's completely the programmers wish to use any data visualization method to find the correlation.
                 
          RANDOM FOREST METHOD
To explain this first we need to know about DECISION TREES. 
Decision trees are mainly used in prediction and decision making situation. 
It works like human thinking process.
Random forest method is the method which is a collection of many decision trees combined together,
This is also an ensemble learning method.
